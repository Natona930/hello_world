# hello_world
Just starting to learn and use Github on a beginner project.
Hi I'm Peter and been looking forward to learn this for a while now.  It will help me automate my home projects my way.  My brother does this for a living, and I'm an electrical engineer.  Who does a lot of PLC work on large one of a kind machines.  This is very similar, and I find that amazing.  Just how our fields have come together to make what we have today.
